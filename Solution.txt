In order to track down our potential witness, we need to figure out where she lives.

Try using 'head' on some of the files like 'people' and 'vehicles' and see where we might find that.
To go to the street someone lives on, use the file
for that street name in the 'streets' subdirectory.
To knock on their door and investigate, read the line number
they live on from the file.  If a line looks like gibberish, you're at the wrong house.

To find all the Annabels' addresses, use the 'people' file:

        grep "Annabel" people

Notice that not all of the results are worth investigating.  Remember what we know about Annabel.
$ grep "Annabel" people
Annabel Sun     F       26      Hart Place, line 40
Oluwasegun Annabel      M       37      Mattapan Street, line 173
Annabel Church  F       38      Buckingham Place, line 179
Annabel Fuglsang        M       40      Haley Street, line 176
"Interview" the two possible witnesses by reading the correct line from the streets they live on:

        head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1

This will give you just line 173 of Mattapan street, because it will take first 173 lines, and then take
the last line from those.
Name of killer:
Annabel
